# Drizzle ORM  
> Drizzle is a good friend who's there for you when necessary and doesn't bother when you need some space.

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head üê≤

It looks and feels simple, performs on day _1000_ of your project, 
lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.  

**It's the only ORM with both [relational](/docs/rqb) and [SQL-like](/docs/select) query APIs**, 
providing you best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. 
Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and **serverless-ready by design**.
Drizzle is not just a library, it's an experience ü§©

**ORM** stands for _object relational mapping_, and developers tend to call Django-like or Spring-like tools an ORM. 
We trully believe it's a misconception based on legacy nomenclature and we call them **data frameworks**.


**Drizzle** lets you build your project the way you want, without interfering with your project or structure. 

Using Drizzle you can define & manage database schemas in TypeScript, access your data in a SQL-like 
or relational way, and take advantage of opt in tools 
to push your developer experience _through the roof_ ü§Ø 

## Why SQL-like?
**If you know SQL ‚Äî you know Drizzle**.
  
Other ORMs and data frameworks tend to deviate/abstract you away from SQL which 
leads to a double learning curve ‚Äî needi
